<!-- ## Day 1 - James was a Fisherman -->

Jesus called James to come and follow him and become a disciple. A disciple is a name for someone who follows Jesus.

The gospel of Luke records how Jesus calls the first disciples. When I read the bible, I pray before I start to read. I ask God to move in my heart by his Holy Spirit. You may want to pray (talk) to God before you read this account of the Apostle James becoming Jesusâ€™ disciple.
